A minecraft fabric mod:
玩家处于亮度小于6的黑暗环境里15秒后，每过2秒受到1点伤害。

为什么会有这个模组？ 因为我正在制作一个困难生存冒险整合包，发现很多玩家利用光影的亮度进行作弊。 这些玩家（甚至有的主播）打着“困难生存”的旗号，却用着夜视材质包、光影亮度、亮度调节器等进行作弊，还美其名曰“反骨是玩家的本性。”

这些作弊玩家不花时间研究玩法技巧，相反费神费力寻找作弊手段，实在可悲！

When you are in a dark environment(light level less-than 6) without night-vision effect for more than 15 seconds, you will take 1 damage every 2 seconds.

Why does this mod exist? Because I was working on a hard survival adventure modpack and found that a lot of players were using the shaders to cheat.
These players (and even some anchors) under the banner of "difficult survival", but with night vision resourcepacks, light and shadow brightness, brightness regulator and so on to cheat, but also beautiful name "anti-bone is the nature of the player."

These cheating players do not spend time studying the gameplay skills, instead of trying to find a way to cheat, it is sad!
